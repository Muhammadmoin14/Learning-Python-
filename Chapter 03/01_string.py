#! Introduction to String in Python 

name = "Muhammad" #? String is immutable which mean it can't be changed


#* To find lenght of string we used :

namelen = len(name)
print(namelen)

#* String Slicing
#* Index starts from 0 and ends at -1


nameshort = name[0:4]    #? 0 till 3 is inclusive and 4 is exclusive
print(nameshort);        #? Output will be 'Muha'
